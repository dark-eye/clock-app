ReadMe - Ubuntu Clock App
=========================

Ubuntu Clock App is the official clock app for Ubports. We follow an open
source model where the code is available to anyone to branch and hack on. The
ubuntu clock app follows a test driven development (TDD) where tests are
written in parallel to feature implementation to help spot regressions easier.
